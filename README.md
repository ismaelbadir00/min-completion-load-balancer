# Min-Completion Load Balancer (Internet HW4)

This project implements a predictive load-balancing policy that forwards each incoming request to the server
with the smallest predicted completion time (“min completion / finish-time” scheduling).

## Repository structure
- code/ - implementation files
- docs/ - assignment PDF / documentation (if you move it there)

## How to run
Update this section with the exact command required by the assignment (e.g., client/server/lb scripts).
